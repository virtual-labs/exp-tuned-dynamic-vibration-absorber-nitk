Given Data:

a) m<sub>1</sub> = Mass of the machine <br>
b) k<sub>1</sub> = Stiffness of the machine <br>
c) m<sub>2</sub> = Mass of the absorber <br>
d) k<sub>2</sub> = Stiffness of the absorber <br>

A tuned dynamic vibration absorber is designed to isolate the fundamental natural frequency of the machine away from the excitation frequency. Therefore, for a machine with mass m<sub>1</sub> and stifness k<sub>1</sub>  there exist a vibration absorber of mass m<sub>2</sub> and stifness k<sub>2</sub>. 

Steps to use the simulator:
1. The simulation will open with default values to show the behavior of the system for that input. The user can change it accordingly, to observe different responses.

For a set of mass m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub> and stiffness k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>, natural frequencies &omega;<sub>1</sub>and &omega;<sub>2</sub> are displayed. Adjusting &omega; to either of the natural frequencies will show resonance. 

2. Clicking on the graph button will show the plots of frequency ratio versus transmissibility of mass m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>.
