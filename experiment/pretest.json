        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). An active vibration absorber is a device designed to reduce the amplitude of vibrations in a mechanical system. When the system vibrates at its resonant frequency, the absorber absorbs energy and introduces an out-of-phase vibration that cancels the original vibration. This effectively reduces the amplitude of vibrations.",
