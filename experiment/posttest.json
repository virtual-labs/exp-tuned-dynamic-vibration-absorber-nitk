        "a": "Correct, the rigth answer is (a). Isolators are devices that mechanically decouple a system from its surroundings. They reduce the transmission of vibrations or shocks from one part of the system to another. Vibration absorbers, such as tuned mass dampers or tuned liquid dampers, absorb energy from the system’s vibrations. They work by introducing an out-of-phase vibration that cancels the original vibration, effectively reducing its amplitude.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). A vibration absorber is used to reduce the amplitude of excitation, not to increase the amplitude.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). A vibration absorber doesn't introoduced several new peaks. It is used to reduce the amplitude of peaks.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). A vibration absorber is used to reduce the amplitude of excitation by shifting natural frequency of system away from excitation frequency. It achieves this by tuning its oscillation frequency to be close to the system’s resonant frequency. When the system vibrates at its resonant frequency, the absorber introduces an out-of-phase vibration that cancels the original vibration, effectively reducing its amplitude.",
