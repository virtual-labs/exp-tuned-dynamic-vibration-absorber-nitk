 A vibration absorber is a mechanical device which is tuned to reduce or eliminate undesired vibrations, it must shift the natural frequencies, away from the excitation frequency, as shown in Fig. 1.

 An additional spring mass system is attached to the main spring mass system, so that the resonance of the original system will not occur. The addition of spring mass system results in a two degree of freedom system, having two natural frequencies. General applications include reciprocating tools such as saws, drills, rotary hammers which requires to balance the reciprocating force. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of an undamped dynamic vibration absorber.

This shows that the force exerted by the auxiliary spring is opposite to the impressed force, neutralizing it, thus reducing X<sub>1</sub> to zero.
